WAV files can be converted to 8svx by using wav28svx software.
See here:

The 8svx files can then be played back with Play16, but DataTypes API
seems to have problems with opening them if the SFX is short but has
a high sample rate. To omit this problem, open the WAV file in Audacity
and downsample to 8KHz or something, then in wav28svx force the same
sample rate with '-sr=8000' argument.


Play16 is available on Aminet:
